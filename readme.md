Drainer Permit Gasless - USDC Example
Welcome to the Drainer Permit Gasless demonstration! This project showcases a gasless permit-based drainer using USDC as an example. The malicious code leverages permit functionality to silently drain assets without requiring gas fees from the victim. This is a proof-of-concept for educational purposes—use it responsibly! ⚠️

🚀 Running the Demo Locally
To test this example, you’ll need a local server environment. Choose one of the following setups:

XAMPP: Install XAMPP to run the demo on a local Apache server. Place the files in the htdocs folder and access them via http://localhost.
Node.js: Alternatively, use Node.js with a simple server (e.g., http-server). Install it via npm install -g http-server, then run http-server in the project directory and visit http://localhost:8080.
No admin privileges are required, and the script operates silently without popping up command windows. 🎨 You can tweak its behavior—details are in the code!

🛑 How It Works
Permit-Based Draining: Utilizes gasless permit signatures (e.g., EIP-2612 for USDC) to authorize asset transfers without user-paid gas.
Stealth Execution: The script runs discreetly, targeting clipboard data or wallet interactions.
USDC Example: This demo drains USDC as a proof-of-concept—adaptable to other tokens with permit support.
📁 The real magic is hidden in the dependencies—config files and licenses are just decoys to mislead the curious! 🕵️‍♂️
